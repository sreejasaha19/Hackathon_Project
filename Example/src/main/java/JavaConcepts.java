	//Class is collection of attributes and behavior. Class is logical entity/Blueprint. will not occupy space in memory. class contains variables and methods.
	//object is a instance of class. Object is physical, needs space in memory. we can create any number of objects for 1 class. objects are independent.
	//Constructor is automatically invoked at the time of object creation.
	//Method is a block or group of statement which will perform certain task. we have to call the method through object.
	//When varriables are taken indide a method or constructor, they are called parameters
//	constructor(int a, int b){
//		
//	}
	//Here a and b are parameters. When data are passed into variables they are called arguments
	//To differentiate between the class variable and local variable we use this keyword. this keyword belongs to class variable.
	//static - if the variable and value are common across all the objects, then we can make that staic. if we change the value of static variable, it will get updated in everywhere
	//Multiple inheritance is not supported in java because when there are multiple parent class which contain duplicate methods by default from object class. so java gets confused that which method it will inherit as there are duplicate methods in multiple pARENT CLASS
